## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Port 3000 already in use?**
- Vite will automatically pick the next available port
- Check the terminal for the actual URL

**npm command not found?**
- Install Node.js from nodejs.org
- Restart your terminal after installation

**Styles look broken?**
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
- Restart dev server: `npm run dev`

**Changes not appearing?**
- Vite has hot reload - changes should appear instantly
- If not, try refreshing the browser (F5)

- **Images**: Using Unsplash and Pravatar for placeholder images
